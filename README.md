segments
========

Segments is a clone of IGF winner "Perfection".
I made this for fun over the summer break of 2013.

Do whatever the hell you want with it, there's some cool polygon processing code in there.

Written in C++ with some image processing scripts written in Python.
Used Cocos2D-x, and various code scattered around Stack Overflow.
